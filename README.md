# score_team

The Team Counter App is a simple, intuitive Flutter application designed to track and manage scores for two competing teams. Each team has its own score display, and users can add points incrementally by 1, 2, or 3 points using dedicated buttons. The app also includes a reset button that resets both teams' scores to zero, making it ideal for games, sports, quizzes, or any scenario where real-time score tracking is needed.
